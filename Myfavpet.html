        Information:
        <br>
        Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha.
        <br>
        Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic 
        <br>
        rabbit. Happy rabbits practice a cute behavior known as a “binky:” they jump up in the air and twist and spin around!
        <br>
        A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe, and a male is a buck. A group of rabbits is called a herd.
        <br>
        Rabbits are herbivores, eating a diet entirely of grasses and other plants.

    <p> Information:
        <br>
        A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens display primary altriciality and are totally dependent on their 
        <br>
        mothers for survival. They normally do not open their eyes for seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens develop
        <br>
        quickly and begin to explore the world outside their nest.

    <p> Information:
        <br>
        A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (2.2–3.3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15–24 lb).
        <br>
        All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly 
       <br>
        seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
